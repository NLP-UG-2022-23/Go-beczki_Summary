Semantics**\n","\n","Semantics is the field of study focused on **meaning**. It encompasses the examination of how words, phrases, and sentences convey meaning and how meaning is understood and interpreted by individuals. Within semantics, there are two fundamental types of meaning: **conceptual meaning** and **associative meaning**.\n","\n","### **Types of meaning**\n","\n","**Conceptual meanin**g refers to the shared understanding of a word or expression that applies universally. It involves the core characteristics and defining features that define the concept represented by a word. For example, the conceptual meaning of the word \"sea\" includes attributes such as being large and filled with saltwater. These characteristics hold true for everyone and form the basis of our understanding of the word.\n","\n","On the other hand, **associative meaning** involves the personal associations and connotations that individuals attach to words. These associations can vary from person to person based on their experiences, emotions, or cultural backgrounds. For instance, when someone hears the word \"sea,\" their associative meaning might include notions of pirates, shipwrecks, storms, or battles. These associations are subjective and may not be shared by others.\n","\n","### **Reference and Sense**\n","\n","In the study of semantics, the concepts of **reference** and **sense** play important roles. **Reference** refers to what an expression or word refers to in the real world. It is the connection between language and the objects or entities it represents. For example, the expression \"Wikibooks\" refers to the website where the book is found, while \"Barack Obama\" refers to the first black president of the United States. **Sense**, on the other hand, is different from reference as it does not deal with the actual objects in the world. It focuses on the abstract meaning associated with words. When looking up a word in a dictionary, the definitions provided usually describe the sense or senses of the word. For instance, the entry for \"plane\" in a dictionary might include senses like \"an airplane,\" \"a level or flat surface,\" or \"a level of existence or development.\" These senses are not directly related to specific objects in the real world but rather represent abstract meanings.\n","\n","### **Semantic Features**\n","\n","**Semantic features** are employed to express meaning in a systematic way. They are the **attributes** or **characteristics** associated with words or concepts that contribute to their overall meaning. For instance, the word \"castle\" can be described with semantic features such as [+large], [+building], and [+fortified]. In contrast, a house that is easy to attack would not be considered a castle because it lacks the [+fortified] feature. Semantic features can be organized and represented in a table, allowing for a structured analysis of meaning.\n","\n","![5753963_orig

**Lexical Relations**\n","\n","**Lexical relations** are crucial in understanding how words relate to each other in terms of meaning. Various types of lexical relations exist, including homophony, homonymy, polysemy, synonymy, antonymy, reversives, converse antonyms, hyponymy, prototypes, metonymy, synecdoche, metaphor, transferred epithet, and collocation. These relations provide insights into the connections and distinctions between words.\n","\n","1. **Homophony**: When two words have the same pronunciation, but are written \n","differently and mean different things, such as bare and bear.\n","\n","2. **Homonymy**: When two words have the same pronunciation and spelling, but mean different things, such as the verb bear and the noun bear.\n","3. **Polysemy**: When a single word has multiple meanings. For example, the verb bear can mean tolerate, but also bring (he bore gifts) or have (they bear a certain resemblance).\n","4. **Synonymy**: When two words are close in meaning, such as the synonyms insinuate and suggest. Although they are similar, they are not identical.\n","5. **Antonymy**: When two words have opposite meanings, such as the unmarked pair of antonyms happy and sad or the marked pair of antonyms unhappy and happy. There are two types of antonyms:\n","* Gradable antonyms: These are words with various degrees, such as happy and sad. Not happy is not the same as sad.\n","* Non-gradable antonyms: These are words without degrees; it's either one way or the other, such as on and off. Your computer is either one or the other: it is not on indicates it is off.\n","\n","6. **Hyponymy**: When one word indicates a category of things that is a subset of the category of things indicated by another word. For example, child is a hyponym of human, which is a superordinate of child. Child and adult are called cohyponyms.\n","\n","7. **Metonymy**: When a word is used in place of another related word. For example, you can say he found solace in the bottle if you want to express the idea that he drank alcohol to comfort himself. Using bottle instead of alcohol is metonymy.\n","8. **Metaphor**: When a word is replaced with another because of similar attributes. For example, the Chinese word for communication, goutong, originally meant 'to merge two river channels into one by dreding'.\n","9. **Transferred epithet**: It is when a word, usually an adjective, describes another word, but actually describes a third concept. For example, happy in a happy morning describes not the morning, but the mood of the speaker during the morning.\n","10. **Collocation**: When two words go well with each other, such as deliver and speech, formulate and policy, and interesting and proposition. These are found by looking at statistics in a corpus, or a collection of language in use.\n","\n","### **Semantic Roles**\n","\n","**Semantic roles**, also known as **thematic roles**, refer to the different roles played by words or phrases in expressing meaning within a sentence. These roles provide information about the relationships between the participants and the actions or events described in a sentence. Here are some common semantic roles:\n","\n","* **Agent**: The agent is the entity or person who performs the action in a sentence. For example, in the sentence \"The cat chased the mouse,\" the cat is the agent.\n","\n","* **Theme** or **Patient**: The theme or patient is the entity or thing that undergoes or receives the action. In the same sentence, the mouse is the theme or patient.\n","\n","* **Experiencer**: The experiencer is the entity that experiences a particular state or sensation. For instance, in the sentence \"The child saw a beautiful rainbow,\" the child is the experiencer.\n","\n","* **Instrument**: The instrument is the object or means used by the agent to perform an action. For example, in the sentence \"She cut the cake with a knife,\" the knife is the instrument.\n","\n","* **Recipient**: The recipient is the entity that receives something from another entity. In the sentence \"John gave a gift to Mary,\" Mary is the recipient.\n","\n","* **Time**: The time role indicates the temporal aspect of an action, specifying when it occurs. For instance, in the sentence \"She arrived at the party at 8 PM,\" \"at 8 PM\" serves as the time role.\n","\n","These semantic roles help provide a deeper understanding of the relationships between words and their functions within a sentence, contributing to the overall meaning conveyed.\n","\n","### **Propositions**\n","\n","**Propositions** are the central units of meaning in semantics. They are statements or expressions that can be evaluated as true or false. For example, \"Xi Jinping is the paramount leader of China\" and \"Tomatoes are blood-sucking mammoths\" are propositions, where the truth value of the first proposition can be asserted as true, while the second proposition is clearly false. Propositions can also be expressed in the form of questions or commands, such as \"Is Wikibooks a city in Canada?\" or \"Get out of my house!\" Even though these sentences are not asserting the truth value explicitly, they still convey propositions that can be evaluated as true or false. It is important to note that different sentences can express the same proposition, as exemplified by the sentences \"Roses have thorns\" and \"Plants of the genus rosa possess spinose structures.\" Despite the differences in wording, both sentences convey the same proposition, which is true if roses indeed have thorns.\n","\n"],"metadata":{"id":"Hejv0Fu0deHe"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":[],"metadata":{"id":"InzUAeCGeMdN","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1686588355855,"user_tz":-120,"elapsed":256,"user":{"displayName":"Mateusz Mudrak","userId":"08166964553004218205"}}},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]}]}
