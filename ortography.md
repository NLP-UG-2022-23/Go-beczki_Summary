# Ortography

1) A language's ortography is its writing system's integral part. *glyphs, graphemes, and allographs* are just some of the core elements of this branch of linguistics, but their breadth suffices for a basic linguistic analysis.

2) Writing systems are varied, but they all share one common factor: they are supposed to be written in a certain direction. The most common: *Left-to-right, right-to-left, top-to-bottom*, writing *scripts* are characterised by a specific (but not unique) directionality, with some cases (Japanese) of two or more options being possible to use.

3) Spelling of particular words is predominantly ruled by the language's phonology and morphology, with some languages containing large numbers of borrowed words. These borrowed words are either *domesticised* only in pronunciation, or in both pronunciation spelling; rarely in neither. 

4) *Alphabets* are among the most common types of writing systems. The different types of alphabets include *abjads*, notably Hebrew and Arabic where there are no glyphs for vowels; *abugidas* with the consonantal glyphs implying a vowel and therefore containing it to an extent; and lastly the general assortment of alphabets which contain both consonant and vowel glyphs.

5) *Syllabaries* differ from abugidas in that they contain *syllables* and not combinations of consonants and following vowels. Furthermore, the similarities in pronunciation do not imply similarity in denotation of the syllable.

6) *Pictographies* and *ideographies* refer to systems of meaning denotation which use (abstract) *ideograms* or the more literally representative of the real world referents *pictograms* or even pictures. They refer to ideas, not specific words. *Logographies*, in turn, are scripts which use glyphs that represent whole words.
In some cases, notably of the Egyptian Hieroglyphs and in Japanese, multiple writing systems are used together.
