# Computational Linguistics

1) *Computational Linguistics* is concerned with the various ways to approach *natural language*: *computational modelling with artificial intelligence, deep learning or grammars, cognitive psychology, neuroscience and philosophy*. *Natural Language Processing* (NLP) is the collective term for various linguistic studies and tasks, for example *corpus linguistics*, *machine translation*, *sentiment analysis*. Its roots reach 1950s and first *arithmetic* computers (calculators).

2) Key areas of in which *linguistic analysis* is performed with the help of computers include: *morphology, pragmatics, syntax, semantics, lexicography, phonetics, phonology* and *typology* of language.

##### Approaches

1) *Developmental* approach focuses on exploring *language acquisition* in children and adults. It is closely related to fields of *psycholinguistics* and Chomsky's universals.

2) *Structural* approach to NLP focuses on categorising words and utterances gathered from vast amounts of *linguistic data*. It is characterised by a strong reliance on *statistics* to support linguistic claims.

3) *Production* and *comprehension* approaches to NLP factor in the insight from structural and developmental analyses in order to develop AI algorithms for text- or speech-based interaction. Early examples include *ELIZA* and  NASA's *LUNAR*; recently with *Siri, Alexa* and the several editions of *ChatGPT*, this particular field attracts significant attention from the non-academic world.
